Some little Solidity practice bits

I'm a Solidity Noob. A retired screenwriter and cryptocode hobbyist (that might explain a few things ; ) These bits are my attempts to learn and practice basic functionality of making things happen with Solidity.
First things first. No consideration for Gas costs, or Security vulnerabilities in these basic short bits. Inspired by the collections of Javascript algos I've seen. Everything here's been tested on Remix and EthFiddle and compiles.

Good bits for me to look back on when need a reference for something not working. I'm also getting a lot of typing practice and the tangle of curly braces, indents, semicolons and spelling of uint is starting to become second nature. 

I'm a CryptoZombie enrollee and have looked at what else CP, CKs, is out there to find my inspiration for these.  
I need the Github practice too!
